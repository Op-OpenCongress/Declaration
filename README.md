#####A Declaration for an Open Congress

**TO: Anonymous Members & Citizens of the World**
 
In 1774 after years of riots, protests and turmoil sedition transpired when revolutionaries gathered from [thirteen colonies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteen_Colonies) in [Philadelphia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia) as one "[Continental Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Congress)". By the year 1776 with contrite spirits, intelligence, and a pen declared [independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence) for an entire nation. The **idea** of a world wide “Open Congress” is a critical step for human and planetary freedom. After 10 [years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_(group)), 100 plus liberating [operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_events_associated_with_Anonymous) and four [marches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Million_Mask_March), now is the time to call to action the citizens of the world. We the people will lead a non violent assembly to solidify an “Open Congress”. This is our unalienable right to bestow a new [bazaar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar) inspired governing body that is truly by the people, for the people. 

####Unite
